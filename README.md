# dialog-apt

### An APT installer but with Dialog GUI! 

Its a Miracle!

## The First Major Release is Here!

- A Complete Overhaul to its Code Base
- Installation Support
- Live Support, just in case if installation doesn't work properly or just you don't want to..
- Now with 70% More Code but can do better than the Beta Release Projects.
- /*be happy that kevin also sacrificed his human rights to this*/

just ignore that last one.

## Run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/SUFandom/dialog-apt && cd dialog-apt && chmod +x chmod-us.sh && sh chmod-us.sh && sh main.sh
```
