# dialog-apt

### An APT installer but with Dialog GUI! 

Its a Miracle!

You can Type Stuff with it



## 1.0.2 Build 3 Release Patch 🔧:

- Fixed when trying to remove packages, it just puts you back to Startup
- Fixed at Main Install based script, that emits a random symbol (basically Bash just had a stroke) to apt-dialog


## Copy this and Paste to Termux

```
git clone https://github.com/SUFandom/dialog-apt && cd dialog-apt && chmod +x chmod-us.sh && sh chmod-us.sh && sh main.sh
```

## Updates  For Future? 💻⬆️

Debian and Ubuntu Support may Come in Later on!
