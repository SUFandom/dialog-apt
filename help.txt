Fun Fact, You can use Left and Right Buttons
built on your Termux to navigate


1. INTRODUCTION
Welcome, User to my Creation, the APT-CLI.
A Script Made just to Make Using APT Even Easier

And i know what you're thinking..
Why make this when you can just type 
"~ $ apt install pip" ?

This was made For Fun. and using Termux 0.114
and Code Editor app.

This project was born after the End of my project
Elclair. a Pranking script (that still has bugs)
and also ended because it dosen't have a true valid
reason why bother updating it

Anyways, this project will be licensed under GNU GPL
3.0. Anyone Can Make their own Revisions or Help make
Contributions of this project

2. Menu
Here We have the Menu

The Menu has the following:
> APT SEARCH LIBRARY
> APT INSTALL PACKAGES
> APT CLI ABOUT
> APT CLI HELP (THIS IS THE HELP)
> OPTIONS
> PATCH NOTES / UPDATES
> ANDROID INFO / DETAILS

2.1. APT SEARCH LIBRARY

APT SEARCH LIBRARY IS AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN
FREELY SEARCH PACKAGES ON APT CACHED ON YOUR 
DEVICE. YOU CAN SEARCH ONE .deb FILE NOT TYPING
"APT SEARCH xxxxx", JUST TYPE WHAT YOU WANT!

ADDING SPACES CAN DO MULTIPLE SEARCHES LIKE
"neofetch   cpufetch" AND IT WILL TRY TO 
FIND BOTH .deb PACKAGES WITH NO HASSLE, AND 
YOU CAN SEARCH A LOT BY THIS

YOU CAN ALSO FIND PACKAGES BY ADDING >"< ON BOTH
SIDES SO YOU CAN FIND PACKAGES' COMMENTS TOO!

2.2. APT INSTALL PACKAGES
SIMILAR WITH APT SEARCH, THIS ONE CAN INSTALL
PACKAGES THAT YOU TYPE. ADDING SPACES CAN ALSO
LET USERS INSTALL MULTIPLE PACKAGES ALL IN ONE!

QUOTING HOWEVER DOESNT HELP, YOU CANNOT INSTALL
PACKAGES THAT ARE BASED ON COMMENTS. USE THE
SEARCH AREA TO DO THIS AND FIND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY
LOOKING FOR!

2.3. APT CLI ABOUT

ITS AN ABOUT PAGE, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

2.4. APT-CLI HELP

GUYS DONT MAKE ME MAD.. YOU'RE LITERALLY LOOKING
AT IT. WTH.

2.5. OPTIONS
THIS AREA IS HOME OF UNINSTALLERS AND SOME
ADVANCED CONTROLS. BEWARE BECAUSE THIS SCRIPT 
IS NOT COVERED BY ANY WARRANTY, EVEN TERMUX ITSELF

2.5.1. MASTER MODE (DANGEROUS)
MASTER MODE LETS YOU TYPE COMMANDS FREELY
OUTSIDE OF APT'S FUNCTIONS

THIS MODE SHOWS A WARNING, BE CAUTIOUS OF IT.

AFTER AGREEING TO THE CONSEQUENCES, YOU ARE GREETED
WITH AN INPUTBOX, THERE YOU CAN TYPE A COMMAND..
BUT IN THIS BETA VERSION IT WILL FLASH 3 INPUTBOXES
IT IS INTENTIONAL TO DO SO TO LET THE COMMANDS
RUNNING AS BASH, ZSH AND OTHERS MISTAKEN, SPACES
ARE AS ONE. TO AVOID THE ISSUE. THERE WILL BE 3 
INPUTBOX PROMPT. 

HOW CAN I TYPE COMMANDS THERE?
SIMPLE! : AT FIRST PROMPT TRY TO TYPE WHAT
YOU WANT TO OPEN LIKE " ping " , SECOND
PROMPT MAY POP UP AND TYPE " google.com "
THIRD IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU WANT TO PING
GOOGLE.. LETS SAY " 5 ". 
AND ENTER, SO IT WILL TRY TO PING GOOGLE 5 TIMES.

DONT WORRY THOUGH, I WILL WORK ON THAT FIX LATER ON
TO DYNAMICALLY WORK IT BETTER

2.5.2. UPDATE LIST CACHE

ITS BASICALLY TRY TO CHECK FOR PACKAGE UPDATES.
NOTHING ELSE.

2.5.3. REMOVE PACKAGES
ITS TYPICALLY REMOVING A PACKAGE WHEN NOT 
NEEDED BY THE USER, OR TO SAVE SPACE. 
I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU PERFORM "REMOVE
USELESS PACKAGES" AFTER TRYING THIS ONE.

2.5.4. REMOVE USELESS PACKAGES
AFTER YOU REMOVE THAT ONE PACKAGE, THIS OPTION 
IS IMPORTANT TO CLEAR JUNK. AND FREE SPACE

2.6. PATCH NOTES / UPDATES
THIS AREA IS JUST INFORMATION OF CHANGES TO THIS
SCRIPT IN THE PAST AND CURRENT.

2.7 ANDROID INFO DETAILS
ITS JUST UNAME -A RUNNING IN THAT. IT ONLY SHOW
THE LINUX KERNEL.


THANK YOU FOR USING THE SCRIPT
